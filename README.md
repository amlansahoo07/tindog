This project is inspired and developed as part of [Angela Yu's Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) on Udemy. It serves as a hands-on exercise to practice Bootstrap and web design principles. While following the exercise instructions, I have also taken creative liberties in designing the site to enhance my learning experience and to put my own unique spin on the project.
